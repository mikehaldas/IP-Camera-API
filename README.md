# IP-Camera-API
A simple HTTP server to integrate with the HTTP Post / XML API of Viewtron IP cameras.

Viewtron IP cameras have the ability to send an HTTP Post to an external server
when an alarm event occurs. Alarm events include human detection, car detection,
face detection / facial recognition, license plate detection / automatic license plate recogition.

All of the server connection information is configured on the Viewtron IP camera.
